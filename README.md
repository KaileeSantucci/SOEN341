SOEN341 Winter 2025 Project 






## Description
This website (**find a name for the website, maybe StudySync?**) serves as a learning tool for students. It allows students to post their lecture notes in class-specific channels such that other students can view and access them easily. The website also allows for them to upload their class schedules so that their peers can view their availabilities, thus encouraging group studying. 

## Objective
The primary goal of **StudySync???** is to enhance collaborative learning by providing an organized space for students to share knowledge and coordinate their study efforts. By offering structured class channels, direct messaging, and role-based permissions, the platform fosters an interactive and supportive academic environment.


## Core Features
- **Text Channels for Group Communication**: Users can join class-specific channels that include questions, discussions, and posted lecture notes pertaining to the classes that they are enrolled in. Messages sent in group channels are visible to all members of that channel.
- **Direct Messaging Between Users**: Users can message eachother privately such that only the sender and the recipient can view the messages.
- **Role-Based User Permissions**: Users can be either admins or users. Admins will act as moderators that can create or delete channels, and monitor for any inappropriate messages or cases of plagiarism. Users can only join channels, send and view messages.
- **Lecture Notes Upload**: Users can upload their lecture notes in the appropriate channels so that other members can view them.
- **Class Schedule Upload**: Users can upload their class schedules so that their peers can view their availabilities and organize group studying.
